With Thomas Cook finding its departure, this enthusiastic business minded youngster decides to step into the hot field. His objective is to create an application which would book tickets for the user in his/her preferred mode of transport and even to worry about the lodging. He just has the views. You will have to dive life to his views.

# Your role:
* Fork the repo (Fork icon in GitHub and copy the link)
* Clone the repo (In your GitBash, git clone *copied link*
* Work on the Edit files using eclipse.

The common errors you might face while working on the starter code, are:
On opening the code in Eclipse, by default you’d have errors. It is due to system library mismatch. That is instead of your system library, it would detect the system library of the person who has created the started code.
How can you overcome this error?
1. Right click on the project —> Build Path 
2. You’d see errors spotted in the JRE System Library.
3. Click JRE System Library and click Remove.
4. Now that you have removed the JRE System Library, you will have to add your system library.
5. Click Add variable… and click the JRE System Library.
Now you have added your System Library. Check your program, it would be as clean as crystal(without red lines).

# Iteration 1: Don’t be a bad conductor
Play the role of a good conductor in assisting the customer to book a bus ticket. All you need to do is get the relevant information from the user with the support of the front end. 
# Iteration 2: Keep a TRACK
Help the user to book his/her train tickets and calculate the fare by a simple program. Get to the starter code. We have already paved the way for you.
# Iteration 3: EmiRATES 
I hope you would have a broad idea on what would we be doing in here…. Obviously, flight tickets. With the previous booking applications, This would be made easier.
# Iteration 4: BookMyHotel 
Hotel booking would be a little different from others, since it involves the from date and to date. But it should be easy for you.
